  utter_ask_decap_definition:
    - text: "Capacitors are passive components that store electrical energy, and therefore, a decoupling capacitor is an electrical component that acts as an electrical energy reservoir. A circuit's voltage can drop temporarily if its load requirements switch constantly. Decoupling capacitors can supply power at the required voltage. This function explains why some refer to them as bypass capacitors. They can bypass the power supply to act as temporary power sources."

      \n1. Eliminate High Frequencies
      \n2. Supply DC Power to Active Devices
      \n3. Voltage Stabilization"

  utter_ask_decap_eliminate_highfreq:
    - text: "The primary function of a decoupling capacitor is to eliminate high-frequency interference like RF signals, which can get into devices via electromagnetic radiation. Usually, these capacitors sit between the VCC and ground pins on the circuit boards of high-frequency devices to filter out AC noise frequencies."

  utter_ask_decap_dcpower_supply:
    - text: "The constant on/off switching in active devices generates a high-frequency noise that goes into the power line. Since a decoupling capacitor can store and discharge energy, it forms a DC power supply circuit that delivers energy to the active device. This supply suppresses electrical noise propagation by leading the noise signals to the ground."

    - text: "Decoupling capacitors operate like uninterruptible power supplies, preventing excess current from flowing through the IC in case of a voltage spike."

  utter_ask_decap_selection:
    - text: "The primary factors to consider before picking a decoupling capacitor are the AC signal's lowest frequency and the resistor's value."

  utter_ask_decap_types:

      \n1. Electrolytic Capacitors
      \n2. Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors
      \n3. Tantalum Capacitors
      \n4. Surface Mount Ceramic Capacitors
      \n5. Surface Mount MLCC (MultiLayer Ceramic Capacitors)
      \n6. Film Capacitors"

  utter_ask_decap_electrolyte:
    - text: "Large electrolytic capacitors in the 1-100 ÂµF range are ideal for decoupling low-frequency noise. These units should not be more than two inches from the IC because they store energy and release it instantaneously.
      But their polarized nature implies they cannot handle over 1-volt of reverse bias without experiencing damage. Additionally, they have relatively high leakage currents, although these leakages depend on the following.
      \n1. Electrical size
      \n2. Design
      \n3. Voltage rating vs. applied voltage
      \nHowever, the leakage currents do not affect decoupling significantly."

They are available in a wide range of capacitance values, have a high capacitance-volume ratio, and are affordable. However, they have a high equivalent series resistance at low temperatures and experience temperature-related wear. AE capacitors are typical in consumer electronics."

  utter_ask_decap_types_tantalum:
    - text: "Tantalum capacitors have high capacitance values and are less susceptible to temperature-related wear. Additionally, the units have higher capacitance-volume ratios and lower equivalent series resistance than aluminum electrolytic capacitors.
      On the downside, tantalum capacitors are costly and limited to low voltage applications not exceeding 50V. They are common in applications requiring high reliability."

      These units have a low loss, wide temperature tolerance, and low equivalent series resistance (ESR). Additionally, they are reliable, stable, and can withstand a wide voltage range."

  utter_ask_decap_types_surfacemountmlcc:

  utter_ask_decap_types_film:
    - text: "Film capacitors like Teflon, polypropylene, polyester, and polystyrene have limited applications because they are expensive to build. However, they are less susceptible to wear and are ideal for high current/voltage and audio signal decoupling applications."

  utter_ask_decap_bypass:
    - text: "Bypass and decoupling capacitors have multiple similarities, which explains why most people use the terms interchangeably. Bypass capacitors shunt AC noise signals, filter them above a specific frequency or eliminate all the AC signals.
      These capacitors are ideal for removing unwanted signals in input signals or power supply voltages of analog and digital circuits."

  utter_ask_decap_difference_bypass_decap:
    - text: "Bypass capacitors shunt high-frequency noise signals in the input signal of the previous stage circuit.
     On the other hand, decoupling capacitors smoothen the output signal, stabilizing it to prevent interference from returning to the power supply.
      You can use a single electrolytic capacitor for shunting (bypassing) but smoothing the output signal requires two capacitor types."

  utter_ask_decap_value:
    - text: "The number of decoupling capacitors used in a circuit depends on the number of ground & power pins and present I/O signals. You should pick the type of capacitor with enough self-resonant frequencies based on the operating frequency or signal bandwidth."

  utter_ask_decap_selfresonantfreq:

Tiny surface-mount components have a lower parasitic inductance, which gives them a higher self-resonant frequency.
      Ideally, the low-frequency decoupling capacitor value should lie between 1-100 uF. On the other hand, the high-frequency range for noise decoupling capacitors should be between 0.01-0.1 ÂµF. Remember to keep the following factors in mind."

  utter_ask_decap_physicalsize:
    - text: |
        The approach for sizing decoupling capacitors involves three main directions:
        1. Load charging in the time domain:
        Traces on a PCB act as capacitors, and decoupling capacitors facilitate delivering the current required by a capacitor IC to charge up a load. Estimating the total charge and capacitance needed involves considering the load capacitance and the required transition time/peak voltage.        
        2. Target ripple, current burst, and impedance spectrum:
        Setting limits on power bus ringing helps determine the capacitance required to bring the Power Distribution Network's impedance spectrum below the target impedance.
        3. Impulse responses in the time domain:
        Analyzing the transient response of the capacitor within a PDN model involves creating phenomenological models of a PDN using circuit schematics. This can be done using transient analysis in SPICE simulations or by calculating the PDN transfer function and Z-parameters using an impulse response calculation. Iterating through various values helps minimize the PDN impedance below the target.
        Among these methods, the first approach is relatively simpler and provides a baseline estimate of the total charge needed to be stored in a bank of capacitors based on the minimum time required for delivery. For digital circuits with faster switching speeds, choosing a capacitor with an equivalent damping constant that critically damps or slightly overdamps the circuit helps suppress ringing during discharge. As long as the discharge rate is shorter than the switching time, the decoupling capacitor can effectively compensate for voltage fluctuations.

  utter_ask_decap_bypass_value:
    - text: "The capacitor's reactance should be a tenth or lower than the resistance in parallel. Current tends to follow the path with the lowest resistance, so the capacitor should have a lower resistance if you want to switch the AC signal to the ground. Use the following formula to calculate the bypass capacitor's value.
      \n $$C=\\frac{I}{2 \\pi f X_C}$$
      \nwhere f is the frequency, Xc is the reactance. Frequency (f) can vary depending on the board's frequency."

  utter_ask_decap_selection_factors:
    - text: "When designing a decoupling network for a large IC, there are a few things to consider:
      \n1. Capacitor placement: layout the decoupling network to minimize loop inductance.
      \n2. Capacitor values and self-resonance frequency
      \n3. Number of capacitors
      \nFrom a circuit model standpoint, decoupling capacitor optimization targets points 2 and 3, and youâll need to balance the number of capacitors you use with the total capacitance required at a given self-resonant frequency. Analog SPICE simulations are great tools to help you design the impedance of a decoupling network. You can also take an analytical approach. Iâll outline both briefly for the following circuit with four decoupling capacitors."

  utter_ask_decap_chargingtraces:
    - text: "The simplest way to estimate the total capacitance is to consider the maximum amount of charge that needs to be delivered to a capacitor IC, how fast it should be delivered to the IC, and the size of the voltage fluctuation to be compensated. Since most loads are capacitive, you can relate the current that reaches the load to the rate at which the voltage of the signal changes from OFF to ON (or vice versa):
      \n $$I = C_{{\text{{load}}}} \\frac{{dV}}{{dt}}$$
      \nNote that you could apply a similar technique to a purely resistive or inductive load. Let's look at a capacitive load on a digital IC with multiple switching outputs using this formula as our decoupling capacitor calculator."

  utter_ask_decap_guidelines_placement:
    - text: "To achieve efficient decoupling capacitor placement, decoupling capacitor layout should follow the following guidelines:
      \nIt is advisable to position the capacitor in immediate proximity to the source signal it is intended to decouple.For ICs, this entails positioning the capacitor at the pin, while for input and output signals, it should be located near the connector.
      \nTo eliminate low-frequency transients from input and output signal paths, it is recommended to connect the capacitor in-line with the trace. By doing so, the capacitor permits high-frequency signals to pass while blocking low-frequency and DC signals. The use of small capacitors is recommended for high-frequency transients, while large capacitors are suitable for low-frequency transients.
      \nWhen dealing with power pins and grounds, the goal is to eliminate AC or couple DC for power distribution and grounding. Hence, it is advisable to connect the capacitor in parallel with the signal path.
      \nIn addition, decoupling capacitors can be connected in parallel with resistors to filter out undesired high-frequency signals while permitting low-frequency and DC signals to pass.
      \nTo guarantee that current passes through the plane when utilizing vias to reach the power plane, it is suggested to first connect the capacitor to the component pin, and then to the via.
      \nIsolating analog and digital returns is feasible with decoupling capacitors. One way to achieve this is by linking a capacitor between the AC and digital ground pours on the same layer of the PCB.
      \nIn addition to proper placement, effective decoupling for power supplies on multisignal boards also requires the application of sound grounding practices. In the case of ICs with BGAs, it might be necessary to use dogbone routing and vias in order to integrate decoupling capacitors. Nevertheless, if the power and ground connections are located adjacently on internal balls, it is feasible to establish a direct connection to the power and ground planes by the use of microvias."

  utter_ask_decap_tolerance:
    - text: "When working with capacitors, it's important to design your circuits with capacitors that have a much higher tolerance than the potentially highest voltage spike in your system."

  utter_ask_decap_differentvalues:
    - text: "Decoupling capacitors connect between the power source (5V, 3.3V, etc.) and ground. It's not uncommon to use two or more different-valued, even different types of capacitors to bypass the power supply, because some capacitor values will be better than others at filtering out certain frequencies of noise."

  utter_ask_decap_voltage_dips_spikes:
    - text: "To follow good engineering practice, always add at least one decoupling capacitor to every IC. Usually 0.1ÂµF is a good choice, or even add some 1ÂµF or 10ÂµF caps. They're a cheap addition, and they help make sure the chip isn't subjected to big dips or spikes in voltage."

  utter_ask_decap_powersupply:
    - text: "By connecting the decoupling capacitor as close to the IC pin as possible, a stable power supply voltage with little noise can be supplied to the IC. The spiking current generated during switching causes the potential of VCC, GND to fluctuate, causing ringing of the output-waveform and speed delay. Therefore, the impedance of the power supply line against high frequency should be kept low.
      Specifically, VCC and GND lines should be thick and short, and it is ideal to insert a decoupling capacitor (0.01 ÂµF to 0.1 ÂµF) close to the power pin of each IC, which acts as a high-frequency filter. Place the decoupling capacitor as close to each IC as possible. The distant placement not only reduces the effect, but may also radiate the switching noise of the IC.
      For low-frequency filtering, a 10-ÂµF to 100-ÂµF capacitor is generally used for each board. "

  utter_ask_decap_analog_applications:
    - text: "In analog circuits, coupling capacitors are extensively used in amplifiers. The voltage bias of a transistor is crucial for normal operation of the amplifier. The role of coupling capacitors is to prevent the incoming AC signal from interfering with the bias voltage applied to the base of a transistor. In such applications, the signal is driven to the base of a transistor through a serially connected coupling capacitor. The capacitance value must be chosen so as to allow the useful signal, for example voice, to propagate freely, while blocking out the DC component."

  utter_ask_decap_digital_applications:
    - text: "In digital circuits, especially in communications systems, coupling capacitors are used to block the DC signal on the transmission line. The presence of a DC signal across a transmission line means that some energy is wasted as heat dissipated on the transmission lineâs resistance. It could also cause other problems, such as grounding problems or charge accumulation problems between two distant connected circuits."

  utter_ask_decap_effective_radius:
    - text: "The effective radius tells us the approximate distance around a capacitor where it is effective at reducing power rail variations. The effective radius varies with frequency and is reduced significantly with increased ESL."

  utter_ask_decap_power_rails:
    - text: "Layout changes of the power rail can cause large variations in the loop inductance contribution of each on-board decoupling capacitor. Reducing the loop inductance seen from the power pins of chips to the capacitors is a key metric in determining which decoupling capacitors will be most effective in reducing power rail impedance. Furthermore, optimizing decoupling capacitor placement using loop inductance is a no-cost method of lowering your railâs impedance and increasing your power delivery network (PDN) stability."

  utter_ask_decap_parasitic:
    - text: "In electrical networks, a parasitic element is a circuit element (resistance, inductance or capacitance) that is possessed by an electrical component but which it is not desirable for it to have for its intended purpose. For instance, a resistor is designed to possess resistance, but will also possess unwanted parasitic capacitance."

  utter_importance_of_capacitor_placement:
    - text: "Ever wonder what would happen if you skipped decoupling capacitors in your design? Iâve done that for curiosity and here are a few signs to look out for.\n\nAn onboard microcontroller will have trouble operating as the voltage fluctuation can send it into brownout mode where it gets reset. Any attempts to get reliable ADC conversion will be futile, as the analog voltage supply is anything but stable. If youâre to send a PCB that has no decoupling capacitors installed to the field, youâll have weirder problems due to the greater electrical noises.\n\nSo, does placing a few decoupling capacitors on the PCB solve the problems?\n\nIt depends.\n\nThe placement of decoupling capacitors is crucial to mitigating voltage fluctuations. If youâre not placing the capacitors at the right place, the effect will be minimal at best. In some cases, the wrong placement of decoupling capacitors can be a problem by itself, as it could pick up EMI coupled onto the copper trace."

  utter_placement_of_decoupling_capacitors:
    - text: "Unlike finding the best spot for a modern vase, placing decoupling capacitors is easier.\n\nThe golden rule of decoupling capacitor placement is to minimize the distance between the componentâs voltage pin and the capacitor. This means youâll need to place the decoupling capacitor as close as possible to the ICâs pin. If youâre designing a multilayer PCB, place the capacitor beneath the componentâs pad. On a single-layer design, the capacitor is placed near to the pin and routed with a short trace."

  utter_guidelines_for_placement_without_power_planes:
    - text: "Place at least one local decoupling capacitor for each active device on the board.\n\nPlace at least one bulk decoupling capacitor for each voltage distribution on the board.\n\nConnect local decoupling capacitors between the voltage and ground pins of the active device. Make sure that the area of the loop formed by the capacitor connection is minimum.\n\nPlace bulk decoupling capacitors near the entry point where a voltage enters into the board. If the voltage is generated on the board, then these capacitors should be planted close to the location where it is generated.\n\nThe size of the bulk decoupling capacitors is chosen according to the momentary (transient) current requirements of the entire circuit board. Placing two local decoupling capacitors having the same nominal value is better than placing one capacitor having twice the nominal value. The reason is two capacitors have a lower overall connection inductance and provide better high-frequency filtering to the rest of the power bus."

  utter_topologies_of_decoupling_circuits:
    - text: "In a four-layer PCB, the top and bottom layers are component/signal layers, and the inner layers are the power and ground plane layers. As shown in the below diagram, lots of vias are used to directly connect the power and ground pins of the ICs to the power and ground planes of the PCB to minimize the unwanted impedance in the power interconnections."

  utter_factors_affecting_chip_decoupling:
    - text: "The datasheets for some digital chips will outline a suggested way of decoupling them. These recommendations should not be ignored, but are not to be taken as gospel. The manufacturer is trying to cover a variety of extremes, including:\n\n- Circuits operated at the lowest permissible supply voltage,\n- Devices running at the maximum supported clock speed,\n- Peak utilization of on-chip peripherals,\n- The customer using the worst decoupling capacitors money can buy (e.g., the 'Y5V' variety that loses ~80% of rated capacitance when operated at elevated temperatures or near the capâs maximum voltage)."

  utter_1nF_10nF_100nF_rule:
    - text: "There is this old adage that for optimal decoupling, you must combine at least three capacitors, one or two decades (orders of magnitude) apart. The exact progression of recommended values changes from one oral account to another, but the bottom line is that if you donât heed the warning, some terrible fate awaits.\n\nThe advice made some sense back when each of these capacitors would be made in a different technology. Today, low-cost MLCCs combine high capacitance and low impedance across a wide range of frequencies, so thereâs usually little to be gained by playing such tricks â at least not for circuits operating at 'hobby' speeds. A single 100 nF or 1 ÂµF MLCC per each functionally distinct digital voltage supply line is almost always enough.\n\nIt is true that at very high frequencies â hundreds of megahertz â the capacitorâs residual inductance becomes a limiting factor. At that point, combining multiple different capacitors can offer somewhat better wideband noise suppression at the expense of potentially creating undesirable anti-resonance peaks in the system. That said, a simpler solution with fewer side effects is to use a specialized low-inductance ('low-ESL') MLCC."

        The formula for effective impedance is:

  utter_series_resonance:
    - text: "Series resonance occurs at the frequency where XC (capacitive reactance) is equal to XL (inductive reactance). At this frequency, the impedance of the capacitor becomes equal to the ESR. At all frequencies above series resonance, the capacitor becomes an inductor."

For bulk capacitors, choose capacitors with high capacitance with low ESR to reduce ripple voltages.\n4.

    - text: "Decoupling is a means of overcoming physical and time constraints found usually in a Power Distribution System (PDS) of a digital circuit. Simply put, decoupling reduces switching noise in the PDS."

  utter_need_of_decoupling:
    - text: "As stated earlier, decoupling reduces noise in the PDS. Electrical noise can be caused in a number of different ways. In RF circuitry, oscillators and amplifier circuits generate this noise. In the digital environment, the switching integrated circuits, power supplies and regulators mainly generate this noise. This noise can be thought of as voltage ripple in the PDS."

  utter_transient_response:

  utter_why_decoupling_necessary:
    - text: "A decoupling capacitor is a passive component capable of storing energy in a localized manner. Because of its very nature, it takes time to charge and discharge. It prevents quick changes in the voltage, protecting the system or IC by providing proper DC supply."

  utter_role_of_inductance:
    - text: "There is a property of the capacitors and of the PCB current paths that retards changes in current flow. This is the reason why capacitors cannot respond instantaneously to transient currents, nor to changes that occur at frequencies higher than their effective range. This property is called inductance. Inductance can be thought of as momentum of charge. Where charge is moving at some rate, this implies some amount of current. If the level of current is to change, the charge must move at a different rate. Because there is momentum (inductance) associated with this charge, it will take some amount of time for the charge to slow down or speed up. The greater the inductance, the greater the resistance to change. The purpose of the PDS is to accommodate whatever current demands the device(s) could have, and respond to changes in that demand as quickly as possible. When these demands are not met, the voltage across the deviceâs power supply changes. This is observed as noise. Since inductance retards the abilities of bypass capacitors to quickly respond to changing current demands, it should be minimized."

  utter_core_noise:
    - text: "Core noise is a feature of VLSI ICs, such as microprocessors and large FPGAs, which have a core of semiconductors operating at very high speeds. These internal circuits have to drive signals into internal capacitive loads, can suffer from shoot-through currents, and their transient current demands add to an ICâs overall current fluctuations. The frequencies of core noise currents are usually much higher than those from the other two causes, for example: the core of some Xilinx FPGAs can have power current demands with 50ps durations â equivalent to a noise frequency spectrum that extends to at least 13GHz."

  utter_circuit_locations_needing_decaps:
    - text: "Because of the very high switching speeds now achieved by digital ICs due to the continual die-shrinking by the semiconductor industry ('Mooreâs Law'), decaps are now required at every power pin of every IC. To improve emissions and immunity performance, decaps are also required at least at every other location on the PCB where fluctuating currents are drawn from a power bus, whether the circuits are digital, analogue, radio-frequency, or switch-mode. It is important that decaps connect to the 0V plane used by the circuit their device is a part of."

  utter_benefits_of_decaps_in_ICs_and_MCMs:
    - text: "The most effective decoupling per pF of decap is achieved by silicon nitride decaps created in the silicon die of an IC itself. The next most effective use of decap pF is mounting decaps in an ICâs package ('hybrid circuit' construction), and mounting decaps on a multi-chip module (MCM) is the next in effectiveness. It is very important that the discrete decaps used have the very lowest ESL. Going any further with this topic would be outside the scope of this article."

  utter_amount_of_decoupling_capacitance:
    - text: "The basic functional reason for decoupling digital ICs is to maintain the voltage rail within certain specified tolerances despite their fluctuating current demands. It is easy to calculate the amount of decoupling capacitance C required for an IC using the expression CÎV = IÎt."

  utter_benefits_of_ferrites_in_decoupling:
    - text: "Wherever the impedance of the portion of power bus closest to a device (such as an IC) is not low enough, noisy currents will tend to circulate around the PCBâs whole power bus, including any wires connecting to an off-board DC power supply, and this will increase emissions. Adding a ferrite bead between each power pin and its power supply can reduce emissions by increasing the RF impedance of the power supply, allowing more of the noise current to remain local to the decap/device combination."

  utter_use_of_multiple_decaps_in_parallel:
    - text: "Using a number of decaps in parallel is one way of reducing the effect of their ESL. But this only has a significant overall benefit if the inductance of the decapâs interconnect is much smaller than the ESL of a single decap. Since it can be difficult to share an ICâs power pin pad with more than one decap, the scheme often used is to connect all the decaps to be paralleled sharing the same small power plane. When n identical decaps are paralleled, the impedance they achieve is reduced. The reduction depends on their layout with respect to one another, but 1/n times the impedance of a single decap can be achieved. So 10 decaps with the same ESL can be arranged to have 1/10th the impedance of just one decap."

  utter_ways_to_reduce_decap_ESL:
    - text: "The ESL of a decap is caused by the flow of current within it. One way of reducing ESL is to place two decaps close together in an orientation such that the magnetic fluxes caused by their internal currents cancel each other out. Obviously, this technique can be applied to any number of decaps, but if intending to use this technique, careful attention should be given to their layout. Reducing the size of the loop formed by the current path, optimizing the placement of decoupling capacitors, minimizing the use of long PCB traces, and considering the impact of component parasitics are key strategies for minimizing ESL in decoupling capacitors."

        - V_IC is the IC voltage.
        - V_ripple is the voltage ripple.
        - Z_PDN is the target PDN impedance.

        Target PDN impedance and the PDN ripple voltage are functions of the capacitance, making it a very complex problem to solve. Calculating C requires several iterations. The above equation is more accurate because it can incorporate the effect of the resonance frequency of the decoupling capacitor and resonances that arise due to parasitics in the PCB layout. While calculating Z_PDN for different values of C and f, we arrive at the best values of C to get the lowest Z_PDN for all the frequency ranges.

The actual water supply comes from the rooftop water storage tank, which acts as a buffer. At the microscopic level, when a high-frequency device operates, its current is not continuous due to the high frequency and distance between the device VCC and the main power supply. Even if the distance is short, at high frequency, the impedance and inductance of the line will be significant, resulting in a delay in the current supply to the device. The decoupling capacitor can compensate for this delay, which is why many small capacitors are placed at the VCC pins of high-frequency devices on circuit boards."

Keep lead lengths on the capacitors below 6 mm between the capacitor endcaps and the ground or power pins. Place the bypass capacitors on the same side of the PCB as the ICs."

  utter_choosing_capacitor_values_for_power_pins:
    - text: " It is generally recommended to have decoupling on each individual power pin.  If two pins are next to each other or very close then you can also let these pins share the same decoupling capacitor(s). But if there is enough space on the PCB, the preferred option is still to have decoupling on each individual power pin."

  utter_circuit_locations_requiring_decoupling_capacitors:
    - text: "Because of the very high switching speeds now achieved by digital ICs due to the continual die-shrinking by the semiconductor industry (âMooreâs Lawâ), decaps are now required at every power pin of every IC. And to improve emissions and immunity performance decaps are also required at least at every other location on the PCB where fluctuating currents are drawn from a power bus, whether the circuits aredigital, analogue, radio-frequency, or switch-mode."

  utter_functional_classification_of_decoupling_capacitors:
    - text: "Decoupling capacitors are essential components of electronic circuits that aid in stabilizing the power supply voltage. They can be classified into three types: global, local, and inter-board decoupling capacitors. Global decoupling capacitors operate in the low-frequency range and provide a single current source for the entire circuit board to compensate for the noise generated during operation. Their capacitance is usually 50 to 100 times the sum of all load capacitances on the PCB. It is recommended to place them near high-density printed lines of power and ground wires on the PCB to ensure low-frequency decoupling without affecting the placement of critical printed lines. Local decoupling capacitors serve two functions: stabilizing the power supply voltage obtained by the integrated chip and providing an adjacent high-frequency channel for the transient current of the integrated chip. This reduces radiation noise while suppressing impedance coupling. The local decoupling capacitor is positioned as close as possible to the chip between the power supply terminal and the ground terminal of each integrated chip. Inter-board decoupling capacitors are located between the power plane and ground plane and represent the primary source of decoupling current at high frequencies. Capacitance between the planes can be increased by enlarging the area between the power layer and the ground layer. Replacing some ground planes with power isolation areas can also help increase the capacitance between the planes. Capacitors utilized for high-frequency decoupling: These capacitors serve to eliminate high-frequency interference that may disrupt the functioning of delicate electronic components. They usually have a low capacitance value and are relatively small in size. Capacitors employed for low-frequency decoupling: These capacitors are designed to eradicate low-frequency noise that can result in power supply instability. They typically possess a higher capacitance value and are generally larger in physical dimensions."

And as in a power supply circuit, except for the smoothing filter or anti-crosslinking capacitor of thousands of microfarad, the high-frequency capacitor of micrometers is usually used to bypass the high frequencies. The application circuit of the bypass capacitor is shown in the figure below."

The longer the lead, the greater the inductance and the lower the resonance frequency of the capacitor. Therefore, in actual operation, the lead wire of the capacitor should be as Wshort as possible. The correct installation method and the incorrect installation method of the capacitor are shown in the picture below."

Any capacitors and/or parasitic capacitances in the PDN will offer some reactance, resulting in a transient response in the PDN. The purpose of the PDN impedance control is to minimize the effect of any transient waveform."
